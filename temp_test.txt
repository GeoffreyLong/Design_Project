BENEFITS OF THIS METHOD
The data is persistent, so if we want to add extra testing or graphing later we don't have to perform costly retesting

TESTING AS FUNCTION: The persisting issue is that we are constrained by the tracks and detection data structures...
Outer script will iterate over several different calls to the testing function with different configs
Call it with test(videos, detection, detection_filter, tracking, ttc, description)
	Could add in "info strings" that will say something about the tests
		Else how do we know which tests are which?
	Perhaps declare the methods as detection = @(x) detection(x, params)
		Where x is the image


TEST FN
For each video
	Read in the SRT
	Read in the truth rects
	Declare a folder named <timestamp>
	Declare all relevant files
		description: holds the description of the data to differentiate
		detection_<video>
		detectionFilter_<video>
		tracking_<video>
		ttc_<video>
	Instantiate tracks

	For each frame in video
		truth = Get the specific truth rect
		im = Get the image
		
		detection_time = tic;
		[detections] = detection(im);
		detection_time = toc;
		write all detection info to a file
			NAME: detection_<video>
			STRUCTURE: frameNo, detectionRectangle, probability (if have)


		detection_filter_time = tic;
		[detections] = detection_filter(im, detections);
		detectionFilter_time = toc;
		write all detection info to a file
			NAME: detection_filter_<video>
			STRUCTURE: frameNo, detectionRectangle, probability (if have)


		tracking_time = tic;
		tracks = tracking(im);
		tracking_time = toc;
		write all tracks info to a file
			NAME: tracking_<video>
			STRUCTURE: frameNo, trackNo, detectionRectangle


		ttc_time = tic;
		[detections] = ttc(im);
		ttc_time = toc;
		write all ttc info to a file
			NAME: ttc_<video>
			STRUCTURE: frameNo, detectionRectangle, probability (if have)


		write all timing stuff to file
			NAME: timing_<video>
			STRUCTURE: frameNo, detection


MASTER EVALUATOR
This will take given folders (or all the folders) and will read and evaluate the data contained
Currently reading them all in separately
	IF I find that some tests are coupled, i.e. timing is probably coupled to a few
	THEN I should read all the data in per folder and then run tests on the data as necessary

test_metrics(folder_array)
	for folder in folder_array
		for file in folder
			fileTokens = split the filename on the underscore
			description = fileTokens(1)
			video = fileTokens(2)
			
			if (description = method(detection, tracking, etc))
				run tests for  that specific method
