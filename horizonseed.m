function [ output_args ] = horizonseed( input_args )
%UNTITLED2 This will output an initial horizon estimate
%   This function should be based on the weighted average of several of the
%   other segmentsky functions... We will first have to find where the
%   others are most accurate (based on global estimates of texture,
%   regional measures of texture, regional hue analysis, percentage of the
%   image covered by sky vs terrain, etc)
%   It will likely be rather computationally intense, but will only have to
%   do it once (or maybe once in a while)
